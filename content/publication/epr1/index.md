*Even when we were little kids and did not (yet) know what causality is, our lives were already full of probabilistic causal relationships* Probabilistic causality occurs when an event has a certain chance to happen, but the probability that it will, indeed, happen is less than 100 percent. So, apples or oranges, Joe Biden or Donald Trump - it is all about probabilistic causality and not deterministic outcomes. Identifying and explaining causal relationships are primary goals of social sciences, and a good researcher always relies on four conditions of causality - **association, causal mechanism, time ordering, and no alternative explanations** - when conveying well-justified arguments.

However, the road of causality is *long and winding*, as Olaf Dekkers once said. We first need to master the scientific method to become causality experts. We start from the question and develop a theoretical explanation that is being tested based on our knowledge and, of course, anticipated causality.
