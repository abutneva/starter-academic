Communicating information in science is a challenging task, so after haven given feedback to many undergraduate research design papers, I realised that there are some common techniques that might help young researchers to convey their points in a more straightforward way. I present them below.

1. Remind the reader of your arguments before jumping into operationalisation and measurement. Summarise it in one sentence, e.g., since my theory attempts to explain lower political participation by the income gap, it would be reasonable to conduct a field experiment that tackles (…).

2.	**Phrase your hypotheses as concisely as possible**, i.e., operationalise your statements properly. For instance, if you intend to test educational performance, convey your expectation as follows:
Hypothesis 1: Factor X is more likely to negatively affect high school grades in subject(s) Y than in (…) .
In this example, I have operationalised educational performance (dependent variable) as school grades in particular subjects to make testing more feasible. Also think about how you could quantify your independent variable, e.g., assess respondents’ activity in social networks by focusing on one network and specific content.

3.	**Avoid using the word “different”, “broad”, “many”, and “multiple”** (and their synonyms), as they add unnecessary vagueness to your story. If you are trying to split the sample into smaller groups, use more precise descriptions for splitting criteria, e.g., I want to expose my n groups of respondents of different age aged from 18 to 99 to the stimulus X.
“Different questions” or “different levels of measurement” would not work out as well. Good practice: frame your research design with adjectives and quantifiers (numbers) to make it more comprehensible and easier-to-read for your audience. 

4.	**Write out numbers and entities: we speak about “three hours of participation”** and not “3 h.” Of course, your reader will understand what your intention is, but the  academic community uses a particular writing style that you should stick to. Numbers always catch the reader’s attention by distorting the reading flow, so make sure that you use numbers only if they must be emphasised.

5.	**Justify, justify, and, once again, justify.** Every research design strategy has shortcomings, so try to attach a “because” to your choices even if they are not perfect. By doing so, you will be less critisised for non-justified claims. For instance, writing “I select 100 respondents from each German federal state” would not help. Writing “Sample sizes will be determined, depending on the population size of every German federal state to increase sample representativeness” does.

6.	**Finish by discussing limitations of your research design and speculating about the alternative ways of studying your research problem.** Write something like: my research design does not explain / capture / cover  X, Y, and Y. One could think about addressing X, Y, and Y by (doing …).
