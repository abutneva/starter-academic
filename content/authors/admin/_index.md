My name is Aleksandra, but most people call me Sasha, which is the shortened version of Aleksandra in several Eastern European countries (my colleagues and students have asked this question multiple times, so I decided to make it clear from the very beginning). I am deligthed to welcome you on my personal website! I am a senior Political Science and Economics student at the University of Mannheim in Germany.
