I am delighted to welcome you on my personal website! I am a senior Political Science and Economics student at the University of Mannheim in Germany. This website is intended for networking, teaching, and innovation purposes. As I participate in diverse research projects at the University of Mannheim and teach undergraduate/graduate level courses since 2019, research belongs to my key everyday activities. For this reason, I decided to share my teaching and research experience with you.

- I am teaching Empirical Political Research sessions in Fall 2020, so if this area interests you, you can refer to my presentations, affiliated literature, and projects delivered by my students under "Featured Publications." I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism!
- For an overview of my (collaborative) research projects at the Collaborative Research Center "Political Economy of Reforms" and my independent research, please refer to "Projects".
- Lastly, check out my academic record under "CV."

Have fun!
