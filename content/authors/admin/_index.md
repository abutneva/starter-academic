My name is Aleksandra, but most people call me Sasha, which is the shortened version of Aleksandra in several Eastern European countries. As my colleagues and students have asked this question multiple times, I decided to make it clear from the very beginning. Now, let me properly introduce myself to you.
  
First of all, I am delighted to welcome you on my personal website! I am a senior Political Science and Economics student at the University of Mannheim in Germany. This website is intended for networking, teaching, and innovation purposes. As I participate in diverse research projects at the University of Mannheim and teach undergraduate/graduate level courses since 2019, research belongs to my key everyday activities. For this reason, I decided to share my teaching and research experience with you.

My website is structured as follows:
- I am teaching Empirical Political Research sessions in Fall 2020, so if this area interests you, you can refer to my presentations, affiliated literature, and projects delivered by my students under "Posts." I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism!
- For an overview of my (collaborative) research projects at the Collaborative Research Center "Political Economy of Reforms" and my independent research, please refer to "Projects".
- Should you be interested in my publications in Russian scientific journals, take a look at the "Publications" section.
- Lastly, check out my CV under "CV" for a consise summary of my cans and cants.

Have fun!
